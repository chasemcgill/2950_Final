    "The data that we are considering has several limitations. \n",
    "## Limitations of metrics that we collected\n",
    "- We are using single-number summary statistics generated by the ATP that, broadly speaking, are supposed to assess how \"good\" a player is overall, at serving specifically, and at returning. We do not know, as it is proprietary, how the ATP is taking \"lower level\" statistics about a tennis player's performance and turning them into these rankings. If the \"magic formula\" that ATP uses to rank players and rate them on their serving and return abilities is flawed, that will mean that we are not using reliable or valuable information about their serving ability to predict the winner of a match, which may harm our model. Furthermore, there is an intrinsic assumption that is being made with these metrics that you can boil down all of the important factors about a particular tennis player's serve into one number. \n",
    "- The rankings and ratings that we downloaded from the internet are extremely current. When the matches occurred, it is possible that one or both of the player's ratings or rankings had significantly changed in the intervening time between the date of the match and when we downloaded the rankings. Because we are considering current rankings and only training the model on matches that occurred in the calendar year 2023, we do not expect that the rankings will have substantially moved.\n",
    "- The available rankings on the internet are only compiled for the top 80-100 tennis players (depending on the metric) in the ATP. Some of those tennis players have been in the professional circuit for multiple decades and reams of data exist about them on the internet. For some high profile players, like Novak Djokovic, we can trust that the rankings and ratings compiled by ATP are likely to be very reliable because there is a lot of data about those players. However, for some newer players or younger players who may have recently exploded onto the professional tennis circuit, their ratings and rankings may be skewed by insufficient data - perhaps they have over or underperformed relative to their potential in their existing matches, or perhaps the ratings and rankings are biased against newer players by factoring in \"cumulative\" achievements (like total matches won) into the ranking. \n",
    "## Limitations of predictions made from the metrics that we collected (and didn't collect)\n",
    "- We are neglecting a large number of factors that have been proven to affect the outcome of a tennis match and the performance of specific tennis professionals. For example, certain players are expected to perform better on certain surfaces, like clay, relative to others, like grass. Our metrics do not take into account how the surface may affect a tennis player's probability to win a match. If one player is rated better on clay than another player, but worse on grass than another player, our model may make an erroneous prediction depending on which surface the match occured on.\n",
    "- Our model is missing an interaction term between two players. As any serious tennis player can tell you (we think - none of us are actually serious tennis players), the complicated dynamics in a tennis match can't be boiled down to how \"good\" a tennis player is relative to his opponent. Some players may play better against players that are ranked far better than them because their specific cocktail of skills (not to mention psychological factors that are far too complicated to be modeled) as well as incidental circumstances on a given day like weather and how much sleep the athlete's got, may lead to an upset that we have no means of predicting from the data that we have. \n",
    "## Implications of Data Limitations\n",
    "- Implications of data limitations on people: since this model is only being compiled privately and for an academic audience, we know that our model does not have many implications for people in the \"real world\". However, if we were selling our model to bettors (who may be deciding what lines to bet) or sports gambling firms (who may be deciding how to set a betting line), the limitations that we have discussed would likely make our model unreliable in predicting the outcomes of matches and we may cause our clients to lose money or embarrass themselves."
